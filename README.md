# Neural-Network
A simple model with signmoid activation function and mean squared error loss function. This model does matrix 
multiplication and other algebraic calculations with miminmal numpy usage, but definitely can be converted
to one. I did it this way to test my knowledge on matrices in neural networks, but it would be far cleander code
with numpy.

This is used to predict if someone would survive the Titanic based on influences such as: age, sex, socio-economic
status, and family on-board. Data sets used is included.

Being sick during Thanksgivings sucks, so after 4 days in bed reading and watching videos on ML, decided to take up
a project on it. It's a topic I've long been interested in, and finally decided to do more research on it.

Influenced by giant_neural_network on youtube (https://www.youtube.com/@giantneuralnetwork). He has one of the best 
introductions to building a neural network from scratch. Give him some love and support.

MIT OpenCourseware on machine learning, and the guest lectures of Lex Fridman was integral to undestanding different 
concepts in a neural network.

Many other researchers way smarter and more talented than me whose paper helped with fine tuning the model.
