# Neural-Network
A simple logistic regression model from formula I derived with partial derivatives of inputs to find gradient descent.

This is used to predict if someone would survive the Titanic based on influences such as: age, sex, socio-economic
status, and family on-board. Data sets used is included.

Being sick during Thanksgivings sucks, so after 4 days in bed reading and watching videos on ML, decided to take up
a project on it. It's a topic I've long been interested in, and finally decided to do more research on it.

Influenced by giant_neural_network on youtube (https://www.youtube.com/@giantneuralnetwork). He has one of the best 
introductions to building a neural network from scratch. Give him some love and support.

MIT OpenCourseware on machine learning, and the guest lectures of Lex Fridman was integral to undestanding different 
concepts in a neural network.

Many other researchers way smarter and more talented than me whose paper helped with fine tuning the model.
